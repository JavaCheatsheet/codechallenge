/**
 * Problem:
 * Fortunately for you, the minions aren't exactly advanced cryptographers.
 * In their code, every lowercase letter [a..z] is replaced with the
 * corresponding one in [z..a], while every other character (including
 * uppercase letters and punctuation) is left untouched.  That is, 'a'
 * becomes 'z', 'b' becomes 'y', 'c' becomes 'x', etc.  For instance,
 * the word ""vmxibkgrlm"", when decoded, would become ""encryption""
 *
 * Note:
 * ASCII value a = 97, z= 122.
 * There are 26 letters in English alphabets `a` to `z`.
