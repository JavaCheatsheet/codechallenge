Dynamic Programming, Modular Arithmetic And Basic Number Theory

At the moment I am trying to solve some problems related
to dynamic programming. With some research, watching videos,
reading blogs and solutions, I realized that I was
missing basic maths skills.

By definition, dynamic programming is an optimization technique
that we can use to solve problems where the same work is being
repeated over and over. A problem can be optimized using dynamic
programming if it:
   - has an optimal substructure
   - has overlapping sub-problems

The hard thing here for me was that I was not being able to see
the substructure and sub-problems. I needed to improve my problem
solving skills. Soon after  a in the research as it was becoming
difficult to even visualize the problems and therefore I concluded
that I needed more mathematical skills, especially basic number theory
knowledge.


The basic number theory field covers:
    1. Modular arithmetic
    2. Modular exponentiation
    3. Greatest Common Divisor (GCD)
    4. Extended Euclidean algorithm
    5. Modular multiplicative inverse
