Problem:
This topic, Prefix Sum, came to my attention when I was resolving a problem from Maximum Subarray Sum in Hackerrank.com.
Link: https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/maximum-subarray-sum/problem

We define the following:
A subarray of array a of length n is a contiguous segment from a[i] through a[j] where 0 <= i < j < n.
The sum of an array is the sum of its elements.
Given an n element array of integers, a, and an integer, m, determine the maximum value of the sum of any of its
subarrays modulo m.


Function Description:
Complete the maximumSum function in the editor below. It should return a long integer that represents the maximum value
of subarray sum % m.
maximumSum has the following parameter(s):
    a: an array of long integers, the array to analyze
    m: a long integer, the modulo divisor


This was the question and at first analysis, I came up with an algorith with Time Complexity O(N^2). This solution did
not pass all the hackerrank tests and I wanted to find more optimum answers. With some research, I found a soltion which
passed all the tests in hackerrank and I started to analyse the implementation.

In the description of the solution I came to know that concept of Prefix Sum was implmented. In my arsenal of soltions,
I basically did not think of that and had forgotten that it even exist. And now I wanted to know more about it!

The explanation by Jinyao Xu at link below is really very simple.

As I wanted to learn more I researched on the keywords on that explanation and ended up going through a lot of
mathematics starting from modular arithmetic from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modular_arithmetic.


Some important notes were also taken from stackoverflow
