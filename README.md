    “ For me, great algorithms are the poetry of
      computation. Just like verse, they can be terse,
      allusive, dense, and even mysterious.

      But once unlocked, they cast a brilliant new
      light on some aspect of computing. ”

    — Francis Sullivan

    “ An algorithm must be seen to be believed. ”

    — Donald Knuth

    “ I will, in fact, claim that the difference
    between a bad programmer and a good one is
    whether he considers his code or his data
    structures more important.

    Bad programmers worry about the code.

    Good programmers worry about data structures
    and their relationships. ”

    — Linus Torvalds

    Hi. I am Anit and I am a ever learning
    student of mathematics and computer science.

    I have worked for many years as a software
    development engineer and I believe that I
    have to keep myself skilled so from time to
    time I have to go through the basics again
    and after. Keep updated with the newer
    technologies is a must but not at the cost
    of forgetting or weakening the basics that
    are fundamentals of any technology.

    Hence, the objective of this repository is
    personal growth and development of programming
    skills.

    The repository contains the code challenges
    and their solutions from different sources.
    Also includes implementation of basic data
    structures and algorithms.

    The code base is Java.

    Books and other resources can be found at the
    "notes" folder.

    1. Add unit tests.
    2. Implement CI to run the unit tests.
